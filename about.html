                <p>
                    I am a Colorado-based Software Engineer with deep roots in a small Mexican farming community. As a first-generation college graduate, I am passionate about learning, problem-solving, and contributing to projects that make a positive impact. Alongside my professional journey, I am an experienced youth soccer coach with aspirations to coach at a competitive level, helping young athletes achieve their goals both on and off the field.

                    <p>
                        I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering from Metropolitan State University of Denver. My academic journey was marked by a GPA of 3.3 while maintaining a full-time job and successful completion of the First-Generation Initiative Program in 2021.

                    <p>
                        Over the past eight years, I have gained extensive experience in the tech industry, starting with technical support roles such as call support and deskside support technician. After earning my degree, I transitioned into software development and programming, focusing on automation, data management, and system integration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my current role, I contribute to building applications that integrate automated industrial systems to ensure seamless operation and monitoring of critical processes, including those within correctional facilities. I utilize Python and SQL to automate workflows, manage large datasets, and generate actionable reports. These tools, combined with my expertise in designing and maintaining scripts and data pipelines, enable me to optimize system performance and support efficient decision-making.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My background bridges the gap between software development and operational infrastructure, equipping me with the skills required for roles that demand collaboration, scalability, and innovation.
